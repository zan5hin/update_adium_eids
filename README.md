update_adium_eids
=================

Perl / AppleScript mashup to update Adium buddy list with real names instead of K-State eIDs. 

Two versions of the script exist.

`update_adium_eids.pl` will replace the eID with the individual's first and last name.

`update_adium_eids_to_firstname_lastinitial.pl` replaces the eID with the individuals first name and last initial.

Clone the repository, make sure the script is executable and run the version of your choosing. All entries in the ITS and OME-ALL
lists will be updated.
